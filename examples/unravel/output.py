To unravel the cable from the screws, the robot needs to follow the path of the cable in reverse. This means moving from position 1 to the right, then up, then left, then down, then right, then up, then left, and finally down. At each step, the robot needs to move until it detects a snag, which indicates that the cable is caught on a screw. When a snag is detected, the robot needs to move in the opposite direction until the snag is released, then continue on its path.

Here is the code to unravel the cable:

```python
# Define the snag conditions
downward_force_threshold = -0.2
snag_condition_down = types_pb2.Condition(
    comparison=types_pb2.Comparison(
        operation=types_pb2.Comparison.LESS_THAN_OR_EQUAL,
        state_variable_name="policy.status.z_force",
        double_value=downward_force_threshold,
    )
)

leftward_force_threshold = 0.2
snag_condition_left = types_pb2.Condition(
    comparison=types_pb2.Comparison(
        operation=types_pb2.Comparison.GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL,
        state_variable_name="policy.status.x_force",
        double_value=leftward_force_threshold,
    )
)

upward_force_threshold = 0.4
snag_condition_up = types_pb2.Condition(
    comparison=types_pb2.Comparison(
        operation=types_pb2.Comparison.GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL,
        state_variable_name="policy.status.z_force",
        double_value=upward_force_threshold,
    )
)

rightward_force_threshold = -0.2
snag_condition_right = types_pb2.Condition(
    comparison=types_pb2.Comparison(
        operation=types_pb2.Comparison.LESS_THAN_OR_EQUAL,
        state_variable_name="policy.status.x_force",
        double_value=rightward_force_threshold,
    )
)

# Define the termination condition
position_condition = types_pb2.Comparison(
  operation=types_pb2.Comparison.LESS_THAN_OR_EQUAL,
  state_variable_name="policy.status.translation_error",
  double_value=0.001,
)

# Move right
right_pose = pose(1).multiply(pose3_rpy(translation=[0.03, 0, 0]))
cartesian_admittance_move(
  target_pose=right_pose,
  termination_condition=types_pb2.ConjunctionCondition(
        operation=types_pb2.ConjunctionCondition.ANY_OF,
        conditions=[snag_condition_right, position_condition],
    ))

# Move up
up_pose = pose(1).multiply(pose3_rpy(translation=[0, 0.03, 0]))
cartesian_admittance_move(
  target_pose=up_pose,
  termination_condition=types_pb2.ConjunctionCondition(
        operation=types_pb2.ConjunctionCondition.ANY_OF,
        conditions=[snag_condition_up, position_condition],
    ))

# Move left
left_pose = pose(1).multiply(pose3_rpy(translation=[-0.03, 0, 0]))
cartesian_admittance_move(
  target_pose=left_pose,
  termination_condition=types_pb2.ConjunctionCondition(
        operation=types_pb2.ConjunctionCondition.ANY_OF,
        conditions=[snag_condition_left, position_condition],
    ))

# Move down
down_pose = pose(1).multiply(pose3_rpy(translation=[0, -0.03, 0]))
cartesian_admittance_move(
  target_pose=down_pose,
  termination_condition=types_pb2.ConjunctionCondition(
        operation=types_pb2.ConjunctionCondition.ANY_OF,
        conditions=[snag_condition_down, position_condition],
    ))

# Repeat the above steps until the cable is completely unraveled
```

Note: This code assumes that the robot is able to detect when the cable is completely unraveled and stop moving. If this is not the case, additional logic may be needed to prevent the robot from continuing to move once the cable is unraveled.
